# Ad Ignore

Ad Ignore is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your YouTube viewing experience by automatically muting (and skipping) ads.

## Motivation

Since most ad blockers don't work on YouTube anymore, or only work for a few days before YouTube notices, I decided to create a lightweight ad ignore extension. This is a compromise between supporting the video creator and not being bothered by the ad. I like listening to YouTube videos while I'm doing other tasks, but I get annoyed by the ads. So, this extension mutes the videos, which is much better than dealing with obnoxious ads. This way, content creators get their money, and I can keep my sanity.

## Features

- [x] Automatically mutes ads when they start playing.
- [ ] Skips ads when the skip button becomes available.
- [ ] Keeps track of the number of ads muted and skipped.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you cloned the repository.

## Usage

1. Once the extension is installed, it will automatically start working when you watch YouTube videos.
2. To view the number of ads muted and skipped, click on the extension icon to open the popup.
