# Ad Ignore

Ad Ignore is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your YouTube viewing experience by automatically muting (and skipping) ads.

## Motivation

Since most ad blockers no longer work reliably on YouTube, I decided to create a lightweight extension as a compromise between supporting creators and avoiding annoyance. The extension mutes ads, letting me enjoy videos without hearing intrusive slogans. This way, creators still earn revenue, and I keep my sanity while multitasking.

## Features

- [x] Automatically mutes ads when they start playing.
- [ ] Skips ads when the skip button becomes available.
- [ ] Keeps track of the number of ads muted and skipped.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codr1an/adIgnore.git
   ```
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you cloned the repository.

## Usage

1. Once the extension is installed, it will automatically start working when you watch YouTube videos.
2. To view the number of ads muted and skipped, click on the extension icon to open the popup.
